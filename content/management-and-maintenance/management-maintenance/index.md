In spring 2011, a new tree management programme was initiated. This was based on a tree survey by specialist Martin Langdon which indicated that a backlog of urgent tree maintenance was required. This was reported at AGM&#8217;s in 2011 and 2012. You can see the report below.

The work was programmed over a three year period and has been our financial priority since 2011. Work has been mainly about making the gardens safe, removing diseased and damaged trees and dealing with those that have been storm damaged. Work was essential, long overdue and in the best interests of the gardens, trees and users. In February 2013, two diseased elms were removed. Ash dieback also has the potential to affect the gardens &#8211; we have over 30 ash trees, some over 20 metres high.

Going forward, having dealt with the backlog, our strategy will be positively managing the woodland for the future**.**
