Alan WeddellÂ oversees day to day management and maintenance of the gardens on behalf of the commitee and residents.

Lawns, borders and general garden management is carried out by our wonderful contract gardener, Ian, who works closely alongside Christine.

Professional woodland management advice is provided by Martin Langton of Langton Tree Specialists. Tree work recommended by Martin and agreed by us on behalf of the membership, is carried out by a contractor appointed by the Committee.

If you have any queries, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact Alan.
