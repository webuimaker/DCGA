The top border has been re-planted with a variety of herbaceous plants and hedging shrubs. The three main sections contain purples and pinks, oranges and reds and blue and whites. Summer 2013 saw the border at its colourful best and home to bees and butterflies.

We have replanted the corner border on the top lawn, choosing white and green for this rather shady spot. Amongst the species planted are Tellima grandiflora, Periwinke Gertrude Jekyll, Tiarella &#8216;Iron Butterfly&#8217;, Geranium macrorrhizum &#8216;White Ness&#8217;, Galium odoratum/ Sweet Woodruff and Osmunda regalia.

We have also added some plants to the border which separates the lawns &#8211; Salvia verticillata Purple Rain, Nepeta racemosa &#8216;Walker&#8217;s Low&#8217; and Sedum &#8216;Xenox&#8217;
