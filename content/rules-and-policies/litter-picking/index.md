We do have a litter problem from time to time, generally because litter blows in from the street or is thrown in by passers by.

Occasionally, especially in the summer months, we find that some people leave behind the remains of their barbecues, bottles etc. Please could we remind everyone to take away their litter, bottles, used disposable barbecues etc at the end of their picnics as we don&#8217;t have a litter picking/collection service. You can put litter in any of the green bins on Douglas Crescent.

We depend on our residents helping us to pick up litter. We have bought three &#8216;litter pickers&#8217; which we keep in the shed (with black bin bags) which makes the task a little easier. One of them is 6&#8242; long for the banks so you don&#8217;t have to do acrobatics any more to reach there. If you would like to help, please let us know and we will give you the code to access the shed.
