  The 2013 Halloween Party was a ghoulishly good event despite gale force winds and rain. 25 children from the neighbourhood persevered in trick-or-treating along the crescent and playing games in the garden. The children enjoyed scary feely boxes, dooking for apples, and running around in their costumes while parents enjoyed drinks and nibbles.


  There was a great turnout by children of all ages and some fantastic costumes. This event goes from strength to strength every year &#8211; many thanks to organisers Trish and John, Morag and Cameron and Christine and Stewart.

Children of all ages are welcome to the gardens and we look forward to seeing you there. Please could we ask you to enjoy playing ball games on the lower levels of the lawn &#8211;  leaving the top lawn for those of us who are less energetic!

Each year we hold at least two events for you.  At Easter we have a party and egg hunt and, at  Halloween, a procession followed by a party in the gardens.

We always welcome offers of help to organise these and other events.  So if your parents or grandparents or carers are interested in helping, then please don&#8217;t hesitate to get them to contact Christine Craig.

In the last two years we installed a &#8216;toadstool&#8217; table and chairs set on the middle lawn,  stepping stones on the lower lawn and a &#8216;walk along&#8217; on the lower path.

We are keen to hear your ideas on how we can make the gardens better for everyone &#8211; including children &#8211; so please let Christine know your thoughts.

For new residents with children, the gardens offer an ideal opportunity for families to meet other children and parents.  It is a good idea to ensure that the committee have your email address or other contact details so that you get to hear of any events.  Also check posters on the railings which advertise events.  We look forward to meeting you.
