The DCGA is not accepting any new applications for outside membership.

We have received Martin Langton’s report on this year’s tree inspection.  The good news is that there are no major fellings recommended but we need to keep a close watch on our Whitebeams which have been suffering this year due in part to drought and old age.

**VOLUNTEERING IN THE GARDEN **
Thank you to the small but dedicated group who came and helped on Sunday 6th April and Sunday 27th April. It was good fun being out in the gardens together. Lots achieved, much more to do. We are  making the last Sunday each month a &#8216;drop in&#8217; volunteering session so people can come along and help as much or as little as they like. Start 10am, bring some food to share, we will bring tea and coffee. Refreshments and chat at 12. Finish by 2pm.  Please come and join us. Sunday 25th May; Sunday 29th June; Sunday 27th July.

**DONATED TREES ** Thank you to residents Tiana and Keith who donated this Whitebeam to the gardens.  It&#8217;s planted near the top path so look out for it next time you are in the gardens.

**RARE SPECIMEN TREE** We have a very rare tree in the gardens &#8211; a Cornish Elm.  We&#8217;re even  mentioned in Wikipedia: [Ulmus\_minor\_subsp._angustifolia][5].  It&#8217;s the middle tree in the clutch of three between the two lawns on Douglas Gardens side.

**Archive 2012-2013**

In October we held our **Path Repairing Workshop** which was very well attended by enthusiastic volunteers. Parts of the lower path which were in very bad condition have now been repaired and we have a number of trained volunteers. Feedback was very positive and we plan to build on its success.

Thank you to all who attended and gave up their time, it really was much appreciated. We had 11 volunteers in the end. Special thanks to Gordon Plews who did all the organising and Julia Nicolle and Colin Clark who provided refreshments.

![<img src="http://www.douglascrescentgardensassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_8166_1-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_8166_1" width="300" height="225" />][7]

The workshop was led by Chris Peach from The Conservation Volunteers. The purpose was to fix paths and to train our members in path construction and repair techniques. It means we will have our own trained team capable of repairing and maintaining paths in the future. Chris worked alongside volunteers and gave hands on training.

A very successful Halloween event was held for children of all ages&#8230; Many thanks to Trish and John, Morag and Cameron and Christine and Stuart. It was great to see so many young residents enjoying the gardens.

![<img src="http://www.douglascrescentgardensassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IMG_2342-300x200.jpg" alt="IMG_2342" width="263" height="194" />][10]

We have bought a **new, large storage box** which will enable us to store toys games for children and families, garden equipment and other items for everyone to share. It will be installed shortly, located in the corner of the garden near to the exisitng shed.   We hope this new addition will suit everyone &#8211; we would have had to get planning consent for a larger shed &#8211; which would have cost more than the shed itself! Ian has also repaired the roof of the existing shed (still needs roof felt) and has started painting it.

We have received Martin Langton&#8217;s latest report on the condition of the **trees** and received a quotation from Treeshape to carry out a number of fellings including two large, diseased elm trees. These trees are in difficult places for felling and will take longer than usual to take down which means an expensive job.  We have also employed a woodsman who, with Ian, has cut down a large number of young self seeded sycamores.

We have bought some **tree whips (oak, rowan and hazel)** which Ian will bring into the gardens the weekend of 30th Nov/1st December for planting in places identified in Martin&#8217;s report. **If anyone would like to help with the planting please let us know and come and join in.**

Lots of tulips have been bought and planted in pots most of which were donated by Ian. The lawns have also been treated to improve drainage.

Finally, a big thank you to all our volunteers who contribute so much to the gardens &#8211; you are too numerous to mention individually but you know who you are!  We are most grateful to everyone.

We organise &#8216;gatherings&#8217; at Midsummer and Hogmanay. In the meantime we welcome you to our virtual meeting place here. Please tell us what you think &#8211; we would love to hear from you.

# For Children
 
 The 2013 Halloween Party was a ghoulishly good event despite gale force winds and rain. 25 children from the neighbourhood persevered in trick-or-treating along the crescent and playing games in the garden. The children enjoyed scary feely boxes, dooking for apples, and running around in their costumes while parents enjoyed drinks and nibbles.


  
  There was a great turnout by children of all ages and some fantastic costumes. This event goes from strength to strength every year &#8211; many thanks to organisers Trish and John, Morag and Cameron and Christine and Stewart.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-408" src="/images/IMG_2344.jpg" alt="IMG_2344"  />

Children of all ages are welcome to the gardens and we look forward to seeing you there. Please could we ask you to enjoy playing ball games on the lower levels of the lawn &#8211;  leaving the top lawn for those of us who are less energetic!

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-241" src="/images/IMG_3987.jpg" alt="IMG_3987"  />

Each year we hold at least two events for you.  At Easter we have a party and egg hunt and, at  Halloween, a procession followed by a party in the gardens.

We always welcome offers of help to organise these and other events.  So if your parents or grandparents or carers are interested in helping, then please don&#8217;t hesitate to get them to contact Christine Craig.

In the last two years we installed a &#8216;toadstool&#8217; table and chairs set on the middle lawn,  stepping stones on the lower lawn and a &#8216;walk along&#8217; on the lower path.

We are keen to hear your ideas on how we can make the gardens better for everyone &#8211; including children &#8211; so please let Christine know your thoughts.

For new residents with children, the gardens offer an ideal opportunity for families to meet other children and parents.  It is a good idea to ensure that the committee have your email address or other contact details so that you get to hear of any events.  Also check posters on the railings which advertise events.  We look forward to meeting you.
