Comprising mainly of woodland which stretches down to the Water of Leith, they include formal lawns to the East. The gardens form an important part of the Water of Leith valley and there is a gate leading on to the Water of Leith walkway.

The woodland was laid out from a rough bank in the 1880s and there are now more than 300 mature trees including ash, sycamore, elm, beech, horse chestnut, holly, cherry, field maple and elder.The trees provide a green lung for Edinburgh keeping the air cleaner.
