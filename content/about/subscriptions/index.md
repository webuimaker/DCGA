The DCGA is not accepting any new applications for outside membership.

Subscriptions are due on 1 April each year. The amount is agreed by the members e ach year at the AGM, to which all owners/tenants/members are invited.

**Subscription request forms will be sent to members in March 2015 and we ask you to pay promptly please.** Non-payment by a small number of owners makes it very difficult to keep to our limited budget, as we have no outside sources of funding or grants. We depend, therefore, on owners/members paying on time and donations are particularly welcome. **The subscription remains unchanged this year at £145. If your payment is received by 11 April 2015, you can take advantage of a prompt payment discount, reducing your subscription rate to £125. Full details on how to pay will be sent to you. **

**O**wners of properties in Douglas Crescent and 36-62 Palmerston Place have an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">obligation to pay</span> the subscription – this is enshrined in their title deeds. Owners in Douglas Gardens have a right to become members. All other members are classed as Outside Members and pay slightly more.

**Owners of Let Properties**

The increase in the number of let properties can make the task of tracking down non-payers very difficult. As we may not have the address of the owner or their Agent, we will generally ask whoever is resident at the time to pay. However, the responsibility of payment of subscriptions rests with the owner, but owners may arrange for tenants to make the payments. A subscription must be paid for each household in Douglas Crescent and 36-62 Palmerston Place. You may wish to ensure that this matter is clearly set out in any tenancy agreement.

**Moving away**

It is not always possible to know that properties are changing hands. One of our biggest administrative burdens is keeping track of names of residents/owners, and you could help us enormously, please, by

(a) letting us know when you are moving &#8211; either directly or through your solicitors &#8211; or

(b) asking your purchaser to contact us

During the course of the subscription year, many owners who are leaving are kind enough to pass on the benefit of their paid subscription to the purchaser with the key as a gesture of goodwill. Please advise the Membership Secretary if you are doing this.
