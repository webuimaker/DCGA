The Douglas Crescent Gardens Association (DCGA) is made up of its members: membership is obligatory for owners and tenants of properties in Douglas Crescent and Palmerston Place (this is enshrined in their title deeds). Owners of properties in  Douglas Gardens are invited, but not required to join. Beyond this, membership is open to everyone on payment of the annual subscription fee. There is more information about subscriptions on the Subscriptions page.

The Association is represented by a small committee of residents who are elected annually. The Committee is responsible, on behalf of all the members,  for managing the gardens. We are all volunteers, some of us have jobs, some of us don&#8217;t and some of us aren&#8217;t even gardeners! But we all love the gardens and appreciate what a privilege it is to have such a wonderful facility in this city.

We welcome contact from you on any matter or with any ideas. So please contact us on the &#8216;Contact Us&#8217; page or directly &#8211; our names are at the bottom of this page.

We are always looking for more help so if you are interested in joining the committee or helping in any way &#8211; large or small, please contact us. We are hoping to organise more working parties in the coming months. We have no funding other than annual membership subscriptions and so to make our money go further and minimise future subscription increases, we are looking at ways we can do some tasks ourselves.
