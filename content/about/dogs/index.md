<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MESSAGE TO DOG OWNERS</span></b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">
  <b>Dogs and dog owners are most welcome in Douglas Crescent Gardens, but you are requested to behave responsibly, please, and respect other users. Dog poo spoils the enjoyment of the gardens by others. </b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">
  <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PLEASE REMEMBER</span></b><b>: </b>
</p>

  * **Pick up and take away your dog’s poo for disposal elsewhere.**
  * **Be vigilant, keep your dog under control and within eyesight or on a lead if necessary.**
  * **Keep your dog on a lead on the lawns and the top path. **
  * Bounding dogs may frighten people, especially children. If you have a dog that you are not able to control easily, please keep it on a lead.
  * We regret that &#8216;external members&#8217; are not permitted to walk their dogs in the Gardens.
