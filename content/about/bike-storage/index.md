**Bike Storage Latest &#8211; pilot scheme progress**

Letters are being sent to residents of Douglas Crescent by the City of Edinburgh Council informing them of the new bike storage facility and asking for feedback. Hopefully this will reflect the response to our own survey.  Those who would like access will also be asked for their details.

The letter covers the 6 pilot schemes so it may not cover the specifics we have already dealt with for Douglas Crescent.

The supply of keys and maintenance of the facility will be carried out by a 3rd party and as a result there will be a monthly charge.  The amount is still to be gauged from the response to the letter which suggests £5 or £10/ month.

Should the pilots be successful, there should be future scope to add more facilities for those residing at Palmerston Place, Douglas Gardens etc.
