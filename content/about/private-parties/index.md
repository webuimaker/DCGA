The gardens are yours to enjoy at any time of year. It is a delightful setting for picnics, parties, barbecues and other gatherings, but please remember to be thoughtful about their use. It would be appreciated if you could follow these simple guidelines please:

If you plan a gathering of more than half a dozen friends, please advise the Chairman or a Committee member as soon as possible of your wish to use the Gardens and the date.

  * Please remember to respect the residents who live close to the east end and who might be affected by noise &#8211; music whether live or recorded is notparticularly welcome and may cause nuisance.
  * Please make sure you control barbecues as they may damage the grass, tables or benches.
  * Please remove all litter, including cans and bottles, and take it home with you &#8211; we do not have rubbish collected from the Gardens.
  * Please respect the fact that other residents may be using the Gardens for their personal pleasure at the same time
