**Progress March 2014**

The garden is looking in good shape with the recent tree felling and planting now complete. Spring flowers are coming through and there is an especially good display of snowdrops this year.

All Martin Langton’s recommendations for the trees have now been carried out how.  In February 2014 9 trees were felled as recommended.  2 very big elms were diseased disease and others were felled for safety/bank stability reasons. However there is still a backlog of work which will be undertaken when funds are available.

Ian has planted 100 tree whips including oak, rowan, hazel and beech.&#8221;

The storage box for DCGA is now in the gardens and Ian has completed maintenance work on the shed.

A spring workshop to tackle repairs to more of the path edging is proposed. The one held in October was considered successful and we want to build on that to encourage members to get involved in the maintenance of the garden.

We will be buying and installing a notice board for the gardens as soon as membership funds start to pour in, in April!
