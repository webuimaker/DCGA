We are always looking for more help please. So if you would like to get involved in anyway or have an idea you would like to implement, please let us know.

It could be anything from litter picking, organising events, stuffing and delivering envelopes, keeping this website up to date, or weeding and planting &#8211; or you name it. Please get involved, your gardens need you!

**SUNDAY 6TH APRIL &#8211; VOLUNTEERING DAY IN THE GARDENS**

Please come and join in 10am-3pm. Meet on the top lawn. Do as little or as much as you like but do come and help and enjoy spring in the gardens.
